  --genotype_data_path GENOTYPE_DATA_PATH
                        Root path to raw genotype data to be processed
                        (e.g., containing my_data.bed, my_data.fam, my_data.bim).
                        For this example, this parameter should be
                        '/path/to/raw/genotype/data/'.
                        Note that the file names are not included in this path,
                        only the root folder. The file names are inferred, and
                        *only one* set of files is expected.
  --genotype_processing_chunk_size GENOTYPE_PROCESSING_CHUNK_SIZE
                        Chunk size for processing genotype data. Increasingthis value will increase the memory usage, but willlikely speed up the processing.
  --label_file_path LABEL_FILE_PATH
                        File path to label file with tabular inputs and labels to predict.
  --only_data           If this flag is set, only the data processing step will be run.
  --global_output_folder GLOBAL_OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        Common root folder to save data, feature selection and modelling results in.
  --data_output_folder DATA_OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        Folder to save the processed data in and also to read the data fromif it already exists.
  --feature_selection_output_folder FEATURE_SELECTION_OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        Folder to save feature selection results in.
  --modelling_output_folder MODELLING_OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        Folder to save modelling results in.
  --analysis_output_folder ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        Folder to save analysis results in.
  --output_name OUTPUT_NAME
                        Name used for dataset.
  --pre_split_folder PRE_SPLIT_FOLDER
                        If there is a pre-split folder, this will be used to
                        split the data into train/val and test sets. If not,
                        the data will be split randomly.
                        The folder should contain the following files:
                          - train_ids.txt: List of sample IDs to use for training.
                          - test_ids.txt: List of sample IDs to use for testing.
                          - (Optional): valid_ids.txt: List of sample IDs to use for validation.
                        If this option is not specified, the data will be split randomly
                        into 90/10 (train+val)/test sets.
  --freeze_validation_set
                        If this flag is set, the validation set will be frozen
                        and not changed between DL training folds.
                        This only has an effect if the validation set is not specified
                        in as a valid_ids.txt in file the pre_split_folder.
                        If this flag is not set, the validation set will be randomly
                        selected from the training set each time in each DL training run fold.
                        This also has an effect when GWAS is used in feature selection.
                        If the validation set is not specified manually or this flag is set,
                        the GWAS will be performed on the training *and* validation set.
                        This might potentially inflate the results on the validation set,
                        particularly if the dataset is small. To turn off this behavior,
                        you can use the --no-freeze_validation_set flag.
  --no-freeze_validation_set
  --feature_selection {dl,gwas,gwas->dl,dl+gwas,gwas+bo,None,None}
                        What kind of feature selection strategy to use for SNP selection:
                          - If None, no feature selection is performed.
                          - If 'dl', feature selection is performed using DL feature importance,
                            and the top SNPs are selected iteratively using Bayesian optimization.
                          - If 'gwas', feature selection is performed using GWAS p-values,
                            as specified by the --gwas_p_value_threshold parameter.
                          - If 'gwas->dl', feature selection is first performed using GWAS p-values,
                            and then the top SNPs are selected iteratively using the DL importance method,
                            but only on the SNPs under the GWAS threshold.
                          - If 'gwas+bo', feature selection is performed using a combination of
                            GWAS p-values and Bayesian optimization. The upper bound of the fraction
                            of SNPs to include is determined by the fraction corresponding to a
                            computed one based on the gwas_p_value_threshold.
  --n_dl_feature_selection_setup_folds N_DL_FEATURE_SELECTION_SETUP_FOLDS
                        How many folds to run DL attribution calculation on genotype data
                        before using results from attributions for feature selection.
                        Applicable only if using 'dl' or 'gwas->dl' feature_selection options.
  --gwas_p_value_threshold GWAS_P_VALUE_THRESHOLD
                        GWAS p-value threshold for filtering if using 'gwas', 'gwas+bo' or 'gwas->dl'
                        feature_selection options.
  --folds FOLDS         Training runs / folds to run, can be a single fold (e.g. 0),
                        a range of folds (e.g. 0-5), or a comma-separated list of 
                        folds (e.g. 0,1,2,3,4,5).
  --input_cat_columns [INPUT_CAT_COLUMNS ...]
                        List of categorical columns to use as input.
  --input_con_columns [INPUT_CON_COLUMNS ...]
                        List of continuous columns to use as input.
  --output_cat_columns [OUTPUT_CAT_COLUMNS ...]
                        List of categorical columns to use as output.
  --output_con_columns [OUTPUT_CON_COLUMNS ...]
                        List of continuous columns to use as output.
  --do_test             Whether to run test set prediction.
